Arduino IDE installation, Library download and board manager.

1) Arduino IDE:
Go to Arduino.cc and download the IDE to your computer. 
Follow the step shown, it should be staright forward, even with the new 2.0 IDE.

2) Libraries
Open you browser, and search for:

Adafruit_GFX.h.

Click the GitHub link. press the Green <Code> button , and select "downlaod ZIP"

Do this for:

RF24.h  (by nRF24) and P3RGB64x32MatrixPanel.h (by NeoCat) as well

Go to your Aarduino IDE again, and select: <Sketch> , <Include Library>, < Add .zip Library..>

A file explorer window (or similar) will open. Navigate to your downlaod folder and select one of the above mentioned files and click <Open>

Repeat this for the remaining two files 

3) adding ESP 32 boards to the IDE

Press <FileZ in the top left corner of the IDE, and select <Prefrences>

Almost at the bottom, insert "https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json" into the text field after "Additional boards manager URLs:

Press <OK>

Go to <Tools> , <Board:> and select <Boardmanager>

Tyoe in "ESP32" in to the text field in the top left corner under "BOARDS MANAGER" and press enter

PRess the "esp32 by Espressif Systems" and select the newest version to installation


4) Selecting the right board


Go to <Tools> , <Board:> , <esp32> and select the right ESP32 board. For me its "DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1"

You should now be able to compile the file.



When uploading... Remember that once it starts the actual uploading, the IDE polls the board, and you have to

press the "BOOT" button on the right side of the USB port to enable the upload procedure.
