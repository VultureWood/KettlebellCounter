The casing design is made for 6mm plywood, and was drafted in LightBurn.

The desing file with help line and text is present in this folder, and there are 
two raw files reday to cut. The only difference is the shape of the buzzer hole.

Before cutting, remember to check that the outer dimensions are correct.

When exporting svg files from one program to another, the proportions stay the same but the size might change.

The panels have been laid out in such a way that the total width is 766mm and the hegiht is 312mm

In the VWKBC_OpenSource_raw_design_descriptions.svg file, there a text which describes the design paramaters.

It is highly recommended that you measure your sheet with a caliber before cutting.

If your sheet is, let's say 6.35mm, which is 1/4 inch thickness, design a new casing using 6.25mm as design thickness


Design, description:

The measurements of the casing-less counter are 370x207x60mm
but design parameters needs to be: 370x208x78mm (trust me!)

If you need to design a new casing for your own material thickness:

Go to: www.makercase.com
Choose "Basic box"

Units: Milimeters
width = 370
Hegiht = 208
Depth = 78
Inside
6.25mm material thickness
Closed box
Edge joint: Finger
Finger size = 12.5mm  (2x material thickness)

Press: Downliad box plans

Disable Panel labels

Go to:  Kerf and corner compensation

Select: Kerf 

Set a kerf equal to half your beam cutting diameter.
I use 0.05mm (along with the 0.1mm margin on material thickness.. This has proven to work well when assembling)

Press "Download SVG"

Save it, and import it into your SVG program

Ungroup the new casing and ungroup the existing casing outline.

Perhaps have different design colors to better distinquish the old from the new.

Center the new casing parts on top of the old, before deleting the old outlines, while keeping alle the holes and engraving details.

Then, group and cut.

Enjoy.
