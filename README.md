# KettlebellCounter
Open Source instruction and code, which allow any tech savvy kettlebell athlete to build their own counter.  

This project was my very first large scale project were I got to integrate all my skills obtained at DTU - Technical University of Denmark.  

The Kettlebell Counter project was a Start Up under DTU - Skylab and more than 100 counters have been sold.  
Obvious, looking back, the projects have its flaws and some solutions are not as refined or clever, as I would like to believe I could come up with now.  
However, the counters work and some have been used daily since 2019.  

I developed the counters for the 2019 IKMF European championship while I was finishing my M.Sc.EE at DTU.  

The counter is not just an up/down counter, it has lots of features like ladders, intervals and a dedicated pentathlon function, and it can be remote controlled by a radio link.  

My idea was that the counter could be used by the athlete for training as well as for competition, and everyone could bring their counters for a competition and they would all work together via remote control.
I’ve produced and sold the aforementioned 100+ counters in the frame of my start-up Company "Vulture Wood Electric", before getting an awesome job building radars, which came with a non-compete clause.  

I therefore closed the start-up, and after a 2 years grace periode, where no legal claims or injunctions have been filed, I can now freely share my project with the community.  

This project is share under the GitHub license, which like the Creative commons license, allows for free non-commercial use.  

The intent is for kettlebell enthusiasts to be able to build their own counter which can be used both for both individual training and competitions.  


Have fun and keep lifting
